# Summer Olympic Games Data Exploration

## Project Overview

This project involves exploring a comprehensive dataset of the modern-day Olympic Games, covering events from the 1896 to 2020. The dataset includes over 271,000 instances and 15 attributes, detailing individual athletes and their performances. The goal is to analyze this data, generate insights, and answer key questions about trends, medal distributions, and athlete characteristics across different Olympic Games.

## Dataset Description

The dataset provides detailed information on Olympic athletes and their performances over a span of 120 years. Each instance in the dataset corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an Olympic event. The dataset contains the following key attributes:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each athlete
- **Name**: Athlete's full name
- **Sex**: Gender of the athlete (M or F)
- **Age**: Age of the athlete during the event (in years)
- **Height**: Height of the athlete (in centimeters)
- **Weight**: Weight of the athlete (in kilograms)
- **Team**: The team or country the athlete represents
- **NOC**: National Olympic Committee code for the team
- **Games**: The year and season of the Olympic Games (e.g., "2016 Summer")
- **Year**: The year of the Olympic Games
- **Season**: The season of the Olympic Games (Summer or Winter)
- **City**: The host city of the Olympic Games
- **Sport**: The sport the athlete competed in
- **Event**: The specific event the athlete participated in
- **Medal**: The medal the athlete won (Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA if no medal)

## Goals

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: 
   - Explore the dataset to understand the structure and key characteristics.
   - Handle missing data and ensure data consistency for analysis.

2. **Question Development**:
   - Develop and explore key questions based on the dataset. Some example questions might include:
     - Which countries have won the most medals over time?
     - How has the participation of female athletes evolved?
     - What are the trends in athlete height and weight across different sports?

3. **Insights and Reporting**:
   - Generate insights based on the data exploration.
   - Create visualizations to support the findings and provide a clear narrative of the trends observed.

## Procedure

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Load the dataset and perform an initial exploration to understand the scope and limitations.
   - Analyze key variables like `Medal`, `Team`, `Sport`, `Sex`, and `Year` to identify trends and patterns.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values in attributes such as `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, and `Medal`.
   - Ensure the dataset is in a clean format suitable for further analysis.

3. **Feature Analysis**:
   - Explore the distribution of medals by country, sport, and gender.
   - Investigate trends over time, such as changes in athlete demographics and the growth of specific sports.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Use Altair to create interactive visualizations that illustrate key insights from the data.
   - Develop charts that allow users to explore different aspects of the data, such as medal counts, athlete participation, and event popularity.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python 
- **Libraries**:
  - **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
  - **Visualization**: Altair
- **Software**:
  - Visual Studio Code/Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Data Imbalance**: Certain countries and sports may dominate the dataset, which could skew the analysis. Address this by normalizing data where appropriate.

2. **Historical Data Consistency**: Ensure that historical changes, such as the introduction of new sports or events, are considered when analyzing trends.

3. **Visualization Complexity**: Creating visualizations that are both informative and easy to interpret can be challenging, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Detailed Insights**: Gain a deeper understanding of Olympic history, medal distribution, and athlete demographics.
2. **Interactive Visualizations**: Develop a series of interactive visualizations that allow users to explore the data and uncover their own insights.
3. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provide a clear and concise report that highlights the most interesting findings and supports them with data-driven evidence.
