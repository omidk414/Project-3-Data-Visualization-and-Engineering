# Proposal: 

## Project Overview

The project aims to predict the number of medals a country will win in future Summer Olympic Games using machine learning models. The analysis involves exploring historical Olympic data, engineering features that capture important trends, and developing predictive models. A PostgreSQL database will be used to store and manage the cleaned and transformed data, ensuring efficient retrieval and analysis throughout the project.

## Project Team

The team of data scientists working on this project includes:

* Omid Khan
* Grant Itow
* Evan Wall 

The proposal outlines the goals, methodologies, deliverables, and tools that will support the successful completion of the 125 years of Summer Olympics Analysis.

# **Key Tasks and Components**

### **Goals:**

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Dive into the Summer Olympic Games dataset to understand its key features, clean the data, and engineer new variables that might impact medal predictions.

2. **Hypothesis Development:** Formulate hypotheses based on historical trends in medal counts, focusing on factors like host country advantage, participation rates, and economic status of countries.

3. **Model Development and Evaluation:** Train and evaluate multiple predictive models, selecting the most accurate model based on validation metrics.

4. **Insights and Reporting:** Identify significant factors influencing medal counts and generate comprehensive reports on model performance and historical trends.

### **Procedure:**

1. **Data Exploration:**
   * Load the dataset from CSV files and examine its structure.
   * Handle any missing values and perform initial exploration of key variables like medal counts and participating countries.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   * Create new features, such as total medal counts or medals per capita, to better capture trends.
   * Prepare the data for machine learning by encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical ones.

3. **PostgreSQL Integration:**
   * After preprocessing, store the cleaned and transformed data in a PostgreSQL database.
   * Use PostgreSQL to efficiently query and manage large volumes of Olympic data, enabling more complex analysis.

4. **Machine Learning & Model Selection:**
   * Load the processed data from PostgreSQL.
   * Split the data into training and validation sets, train different models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees), and compare their performance.   
   * Choose the best model based on accuracy and other relevant metrics.

5. **Model Prediction:**
   * Generate medal count predictions for future Olympic Games using the selected model.

## **Conclusion:**

This project leverages machine learning to predict the distribution of medals in future Olympic Games, providing insights into the factors that influence a country’s success. By comparing multiple models and selecting the best-performing one, the project aims to develop a robust predictive system while uncovering the trends and dynamics of the Summer Olympics.

## **Data, Tools, Techniques, and Challenges**

### **Dataset Description:**

The dataset used in this project is derived from historical data on the Summer Olympic Games, capturing key information about participating countries, host cities, and medal distributions. The dataset includes the following columns:

* **Year:** The year of the Olympic Games.
* **Host_country:** The country where the Olympics were held.
* **Host_city:** The city that hosted the event.
* **Country_Name:** The name of the participating country.
* **Country_Code:** The NOC (National Olympic Committee) code for the country.
* **Gold:** The number of gold medals won by the country.
* **Silver:** The number of silver medals won by the country.
* **Bronze:** The number of bronze medals won by the country.

### **Tools and Technologies:**

* **Programming Language:** Python 
* **Libraries:**
  * **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
  * **Visualization:** Altair
  * **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
* **Database:**
  * **PostgreSQL:** For storing and managing the Olympic data.
* **Software:**
  * Visual Studio Code/Jupyter Notebook for exploratory analysis and modeling.

### **Potential Challenges:**

1. **Imbalanced Data:** Countries with larger populations or higher GDPs may dominate medal counts, leading to skewed predictions. Techniques like balanced sampling or weighting may be needed.
2. **Feature Selection:** Identifying which factors (e.g., host country advantage) most strongly influence medal counts will require careful feature engineering and analysis.
3. **Overfitting:** Monitoring for overfitting through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning will be crucial to ensure the model generalizes well to future Olympic Games.

### **Expected Outcomes:**

1. **Prediction Accuracy:** Aim to achieve a high level of accuracy in predicting medal counts for future Olympic Games.
2. **Insights into Olympic Success:** Provide detailed insights into the factors that contribute to a country’s success at the Summer Olympics, including any emerging trends.
